            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I go to school at USU and I'm majoring in CS. I love video games and my favorite is tied between Titanfall 2 and Minecraft. I would like to learn 3d animation and game design (but you never heard a CS major say that) but right now I gotta focus on school.</p>
